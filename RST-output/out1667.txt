Inner:  S span None Attribution SN
Leaf:  N Evaluation it makes me sad
Leaf:  S span but I can understand the situation .
Inner:  N Explanation None Evaluation NS
Inner:  N Elaborate None Explanation SN
Leaf:  N Elaborate We can often do things with unintended consequences
Leaf:  S span that are not noticeable in the beginning .
Inner:  N Elaborate None Elaborate NS
Leaf:  N Elaborate This appears to be the thought here
Leaf:  N Cause that maybe we have caused these amphibians to become sick
