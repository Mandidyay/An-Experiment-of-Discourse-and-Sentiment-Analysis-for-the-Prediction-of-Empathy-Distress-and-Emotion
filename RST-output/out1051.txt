Leaf:  N Elaborate Global warming is real .
Leaf:  N Elaborate The effects
Leaf:  S span that is having on the polar bears
Inner:  N Same-Unit None Elaborate NS
Leaf:  N Same-Unit will soon have the same effects on us .
Inner:  S span None Same-Unit NN
Inner:  N Elaborate None Elaborate NS
Leaf:  S span The research is showing
Leaf:  N Attribution that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and hunting .
Inner:  N Elaborate None Attribution SN
Leaf:  S span The ice is melting at a constant rate ,
Leaf:  N Elaborate but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time
Leaf:  S span that they spend on the ice .
Inner:  N Contrast None Elaborate NS
Inner:  S span None Contrast SN
Inner:  N Elaborate None Elaborate NS
Leaf:  N Joint They do most of their hunting on the ice
Leaf:  N Joint and that how to meet their mates ,
Inner:  N Evaluation None Joint NN
Leaf:  S span so it is very important to them . It may not seem important to you yet ,
Leaf:  S span but as the Ice melts
Leaf:  N Joint it will not only hurt the bears
Leaf:  N Joint it will hurt you too .
Inner:  N Manner-Means None Joint NN
Inner:  N Contrast None Manner-Means SN
Inner:  S span None Contrast SN
Inner:  N Joint None Evaluation NS
Leaf:  N Elaborate Rising sea level will hurt people like you
Leaf:  S span that live in coastal areas .
Inner:  N Joint None Elaborate NS

Leaf:  N Elaborate I hope you change your mind
Leaf:  S span on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice .
Inner:  N Elaborate None Elaborate NS
Leaf:  N Evaluation Our actions may have an affect on the polar bears
Leaf:  S span and I believe
